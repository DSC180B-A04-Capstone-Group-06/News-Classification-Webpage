## Text Classification

  Text Classification (TC) and Named-Entity Recognition (NER) are two fundamental tasks for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, which involve understanding, extracting information, and categorizing the text. In order to achieve such goals, we utilized AutoPhrase (Jingbo Shang, 2018) and a pre-trained language NER model to extract quality phrases. Using these as part of our features, we are able to achieve high performance for a five class and a twenty class text classification dataset. Our project follows a similar setting as previous works with train, validation, and test datasets and comparing the results across different methods.
